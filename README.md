# Apigee Kickstart V9 for Pantheon

This is Pantheon's recommended starting point for creating a new Apigee Developer Portal with Drupal 9.

Unlike with earlier Pantheon Apigee upstream, this pure Drupal 9 version contains no core, module, theme or library artifacts.
If only contains minimal composer.json requirements and scoffolding.


## How to install

Clone this repository to your docroot.  Run `composer install`.  Hit your portal URL to complete the setup.
